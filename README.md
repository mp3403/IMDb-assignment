## Instructions on how to run code

First, ensure that you have GCC installed on your system. Navigate to the directory where the files are located. Run the command `g++ InMemoryDB.cpp main.cpp -o [executable name]`. You may use whatever executable name you wish. Finally, run the command `./[executable name]`.

## Assignment write-up

I found this assignment to be managable and fun. However, I did have some concerns. My biggest concern was the ambiguity in what the submission is and how it will be graded. Example code is given for main, but it is unclear how, or even if, it should be modified or used. In the end, I ended up adding try/catch blocks and print statements to create an error-free and straightforward program. However, I am still unsure if I met the grading requirements. The "Grading" section in the instructions is also not clear. All we are given is "4 points for working code". This raises many questions such as "what constitutes working code?",  "what edge cases will be tested?", "will we be given partial credit, and if so, what would that look like?". Therefore, I would clarify what needs to be submitted and make a more detailed rubric.
